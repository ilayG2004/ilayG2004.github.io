        <p> I participated in a Kaggle competition to accurately predict the ratings of Amazon movie reviews given a

    <h2 class="section__text__p3"> Syngin Technologies Lightning Web Component & Proof-of-Delivery (POD) Generator </h2>
    <p>Attached is a frontend demonstration of the work I did at Syngin Technologies this summer. While I could not film
      any code (for obvious privacy reasons), I could film the features which utilized it.
      The new database I set up had to be connected to Salesforce so that our transportation, IT, and sales teams could
      view data on vehicle deliveries on a case-by-case basis. Attached is a video showing off said features.

    <h2 class="section__text__p3"> Spark! Bytes </h2>
    <div class="description">
      <p>Spark! Bytes was a prototype app designed to help bring together Boston University students around something
        they
        all love -- food. Community leaders could post invites to events with descriptions, photos, tags, locations to
        appeal to a wider audience of BU students.
        Whether it was for the actual meeting, or for the take-home after the fact, the goal of this webapp was to
        reduce
        food waste by notifying BU students of these events.
        Attached is a frontend & backend demonstration of my team's project for Spark! Bytes.
